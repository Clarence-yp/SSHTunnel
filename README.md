# What is SSHTunnel ?
SSHTunnel is an OS X application that allows you to easily create SSH tunnels from your computer to a remote host (like a website) through a SSH server. This SSH tunnel can bypass the firewall rules in a secure way. So if you are at work, and you can't access YouTube?, just create a SSH tunnel, and your ready to go!

# And on the next version ?
The next version will be not a graphical and logical evolution of sessions. I will focus on SSH security, by adding a support of system Keychain to store passwords, and allow the keys creation and support for servers. This next release should be available very very soon (I've play around with OS X authentication server and I've already do the key management on a very old version of SSHTunnel). Stay tuned!

# Status

This project is not very active. I just moved it from Google Code to Github (obvious reason).
Consider the Google Code repo totally dead.
